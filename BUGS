This is a list of known bugs without known solutions or workarounds.

For the 'ordering' field source, locale-aware sorting and case-sensitivity do
not work as expected.  This may be a system-specific bug.

When the window is maximised, the maximised state is correctly saved for the
next time the application is run, but the new window size is also saved.  This
becomes apparent on restarting the application and un-maximising the window.

The position of the splitter separating the controls and the tabbed output
section is saved when changed, but when restored on startup the value used is
not exactly the same.

When installing to a path that doesn't contain the 'hicolor' icon theme's
'index.theme' file (often /usr/local), the window icon is not set properly.
This is due to a bug in Qt 5 (https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-44107).

Saving settings to disk should be rate-limited.  The problem becomes apparent
when considering window size: if the window manager resizes the window for every
mouse motion event, then settings may be saved very often while the window is
being resized.
