This is a list of known bugs without known solutions or workarounds.

For the 'ordering' field source, locale-aware sorting and case-sensitivity do
not work as expected.  This may be a system-specific bug.

When the window is maximised, the maximised state is correctly saved for the
next time the application is run, but the new window size is also saved.  This
becomes apparent on restarting the application and un-maximising the window.

The position of the splitter separating the controls and the tabbed output
section is saved when changed, but when restored on startup the value used is
not exactly the same.

Saving settings to disk should be rate-limited.  The problem becomes apparent
when considering window size: if the window manager resizes the window for every
mouse motion event, then settings may be saved very often while the window is
being resized.

Items added to sections in the controls region of UI (eg. file sources, field
sources) do not cause their section to expand even if the item could use the
space.  For example, adding a 'list' file source should cause the file sources
section to expand and the other sections to shrink if they have empty space.
