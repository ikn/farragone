    DEPENDENCIES

Python 3 (>= 3.1): https://www.python.org

Qt (>= 5.2): http://qt-project.org

    INSTALLATION

There is no installation method on Windows.  On Unix-like OSs, with Python 3,
bash, sed, find and make, run

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The makefile respects the `prefix', `DESTDIR', etc. arguments.  Of course,
`make install' needs to be run as root if installing outside of your home
directory.  To uninstall, run

    make uninstall

`make clean' and `make distclean' are also supported, and work as expected.

    USAGE

On Windows, in the source directory, run

    python run

where `python' is the Python 3 interpreter.

On Unix-like OSs, once installed, just run `farragone' (installed to
/usr/local/bin/ by default).  Alternatively, you can run in-place without
installing by

    ./configure
    make inplace
    ./run

For help on using the application, use the 'What's This?' button located at the
bottom of the main window and then select part of the UI to get documentation
for.  (Alternatively, press shift + F1 while the part of the UI to get
documentation for is focused.)
